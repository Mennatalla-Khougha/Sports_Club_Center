    <p class="short_info">
      Squash is a fast-paced, high-intensity racket sport played by two players
      in a four-walled court with a small, hollow rubber ball. The objective of
      the game is to hit the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to
      return it. Squash is a great workout that can help you burn calories,
      improve your cardiovascular health, and build muscle.
